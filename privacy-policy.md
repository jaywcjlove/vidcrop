Privacy Policy
===

Thank you for using **VidCrop**! We highly value your privacy. This document explains how we handle your data when you use this app.

## Information Collection

**VidCrop** is a video cropping tool that helps users easily crop video files. You can manually select any part of the video for cropping, with a built-in video player for convenient preview before and after cropping. The app supports common video formats including .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .mpg, .mpeg, .3gp, and more. Users can adjust the crop area by dragging or customize video dimensions to precisely crop any part of the video. All operations are performed locally on your device.

**Important Note:** VidCrop operates completely offline. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app does not connect to remote servers or integrate any third-party services.

### a. Local Data Processing

* All settings and operations are stored only on your local device.
* The app does not record your usage behavior or upload any data.

### b. No Logging

VidCrop does not generate or send any logs. All operations and configurations are performed locally, with no remote communication involved.

## Use of Data

Since VidCrop does not collect or store any user data, there is no use or sharing of data. All of your usage remains private and offline.

## Third-Party Services

VidCrop does not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising platforms, or cloud services, nor does it share or sell user information to any third party.
