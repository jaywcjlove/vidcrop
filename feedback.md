`VidCrop` is a video cropping tool that helps users easily crop video files. You can manually select any part of the video for cropping, with a built-in video player for convenient preview before and after cropping. The app supports common video formats including `.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.mov`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`, `.3gp`, and more. Users can adjust the crop area by dragging or customize video dimensions to precisely crop any part of the video.
